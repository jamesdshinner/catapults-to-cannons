<h3>Catapults</h3>

<h4>History</h4>

<p>
Catapults are any ballistic device designed to launch a long ranged projectile, 
with the damage being caused by impact rather than explosives or other means. 
The term 'catapult' comes from the ancient Greek words 'katta' meaning downwards
and 'pallo' meaning hurl.
</p>

<p>
While catapult is an all-encompassing term, the traditional catapult design 
that most people think of is actually referred to as a mangonel or onager.
With mangonel literally meaning 'engine of war', these machines were invented 
around 400 BC by the Romans. They were made up of a long wooden arm with a bowl 
at the end, and would be loaded by lowering a rope with a hook attached to the 
end. This hook would be connected to a pulling system (pulley compound or gear 
compound) to lower the arm from a natural 90 degree angle. Doing this stored 
elastic potential energy in the catapult by way of the tension in the ropes and 
arm. This tension would be stored in the same way as in a spring. Once lowered, 
a projectile would be loaded. The release of the arm would transfer the elastic 
potential energy into kinetic energy that was imparted to the projectile. Some 
later designs would utilise slings to hold the projectile and additional ways 
to impart energy such as a counterweight or men providing traction using ropes.
These ideas would come into the limelight with the invention of the trebuchet.

<p>
Catapults in their various forms were used effectively as siege weapons from 
their invention in the 4th century BC up until the late medieval period, when 
advances in defensive construction rendered them largely ineffective, and the 
use of gunpowder became more prevalent. However, traditional catapults found 
use in world war one where they were sometimes used to launch hand grenades 
into enemy trenches from a distance. As recently as 2011, it was reported that 
a homemade catapult was used to deliver cannabis from Mexico across the border 
into the United States.

<h4>Physics</h4>

<p>
Using the basic spring constant equation:
</p>

<img src="media/images/catapults/eq6.png" alt="spring constant eq." width="50" height="33" />

<p>
where <em>U</em> is the potential energy, <em>k</em> is the elastic constant 
and <em>x</em> is the distance the object is pushed/pulled from its equilibrium 
position.
</p>

<p>
Unlike the ballistae example, the release of energy is not along a linear path, 
since the movement of the arm makes an arc with radius equal to its length. 
This means that some of the potential energy is transferred to rotational 
kinetic energy. The equation for the energy transfer is thus:
</p>

<img src="media/images/catapults/eq7.png" alt="energy transfer eq." width="55" height="35" />

<p>
Moment of inertia for this example = &frac13;mr<sup>2</sup>
</p>

<p>Therefore:</p>

<img src="media/images/catapults/eq8.png" alt="dot product" width="102" height="40" />

<p>Rearranging tells us that:</p>

<img src="media/images/catapults/eq9.png" alt="&omega; eq." width="60" height="43" />

<p>
This is the angular velocity which is transferred to linear velocity when 
the arm comes to an abrupt halt (for simplicity we are ignoring other energy 
losses, for example by friction). The missile continues in the direction of its 
instantaneous linear velocity at that time.
</p>

<p>Linear and rotational velocity are related by <em>v=&omega;r</em> and thus 
we see:
</p>

<img src="media/images/catapults/eq10.png" alt="v eq." width="66" height="40"/>

<p>
This would be a horizontal velocity, i.e. the horizontal component of the 
projectile, whilst the vertical component is zero.

<p>
From our earlier examination of projectile motion, we know that the time of 
flight would then be the time it takes the Earth's gravitational field to 
accelerate the missile to the ground. This will be given by:
</p>

<img src="media/images/catapults/eq11.png" alt="time of flight" width="46" height="41" />

<p>and the range <em>d</em> is simply:</p>

<img src="media/images/catapults/eq12.png" alt="range" width="35" height="16" />

<p>
Another major factor of the success of a projectile is the launch 
angle. This could be manipulated on a mangonel by placing a block inside it to 
prevent the arm from reaching 90 degrees. Qualitatively, we can instantly see 
how this would increase the time of flight, as by giving it an angle, we give 
it a vertical velocity component (the missile's vertical velocity must be 
decelerated to 0 by <em>g</em> before it can hit ground).
</p>

<p class='figdescription'>
Fig 3: A blocked mangonel, with a launch angle greater than horizontal.
</p>

<p>
This will increase the range <em>d</em>. However, by increasing 
<em>v<sub>y</sub></em>, we decrease <em>v<sub>x</sub></em>, so there must be an 
optimum angle at which we can make the most of both velocity components. This 
perfect angle has been proven to be 45&deg;.
</p>

<p>
From the diagram above, we can see that when the arm is 
blocked, the angle &theta; between the vertical and the arm is the same as the 
angle between the launch velocity and the horizontal.
</p>

<p>
We can therefore determine the time of flight and range of the missile:
</p>

<p>
As a mangonel was often used to launch a missile over a wall (rather than at 
it), it is useful to know the trajectory's maximum height at a given angle. 
Denoting by <em>h</em> the original height above the ground from which the 
missile was launched, we find that:
</p>

<img src="media/images/catapults/eq14.png" alt="max height eq." width="89" height="41"/>

<p>The range at which this occurs is denoted by <em>D</em>:</p>

<img src="media/images/catapults/eq15.png" alt="corresponding range" width="68" height="23"/>

<p>
where <em>t<sub>y</sub></em> is the time at which the maximum height is 
reached.
