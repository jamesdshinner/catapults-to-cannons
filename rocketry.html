<h3>Rocketry</h3>

<h4>History</h4>

<p>
In terms of weaponry, a rocket is an unguided jet-propelled missile in which 
forward motion results from reaction to the ejection of matter in the opposite 
direction at high velocity. The well documented rocket equation, which we will 
derive, gives the relationship between the change in velocity of the missile, 
its relative exhaust velocity and its change in mass. The unguided nature of 
rockets is what makes them differ from missiles. The use of rockets in 
artillery is thought to date back as early as medieval China, though didn't 
become a prominently deployed weapon until the 20th century.
</p>

<p>Ancient Chinese legend has it that a local official, Wan Hu, used a chair 
mounted on 47 bamboo rockets to lift off from the ground. He reportedly flew to 
the moon, earning him the titles of 'first astronaut' and the 'man on the 
moon'. Factual evidence to back up the existence of this rocket chair is 
unsurprisingly limited.
</p>

<img src="media/images/modernweapons/rocketry/wanhu.png" alt="Wan Hu" width="220" height="232"/>

<p class='figdescription'>Fig 1: Wan Hu.</p>

<p>
The first documented account of the use of rockets in warfare was during the 
battle of Kai-Keng, between the Mongols and the Chinese in 1232. The Chinese 
were able to hold the Mongols at bay using a very basic form of solid fuelled 
rocket. This consisted of a hollow tube capped at one end filled with gunpowder 
and attached to a stick. By treating the air inside the tube as an ideal gas, 
we can see that the ignition of gunpowder will cause an increase in temperature 
and hence pressure on the tube.
</p>

<p>
Due to the conservation of momentum, this causes a thrust, hence propelling the 
rocket in the direction of the capped end. The long stick was a way of guiding 
the rocket somewhat. These weapons are comparable with modern day fireworks. 
Rockets are said to have been introduced to Europe in the 13th century by the 
Mongol conquests. A more powerful form of gunpowder was developed by British 
scientist Roger Bacon. This increased the range of rockets, whilst Jean 
Froissart created the launch pad by firing rockets through tubes to improve 
their accuracy. 
</p>

<p>
In the British colonial wars of the late 1700s, Indian rocket fire was used 
against the British armies. The first iron-cased rockets were first developed 
in 1772 to be used against the British in the Anglo-Mysore Wars. This new idea 
of casing the propellant was more advanced than anything the Brits had seen in 
rocket weaponry, increasing massively both the range and thrust. The British 
Colonel Congreve, inspired by this technology, began to construct his own 
model of rocket for the British forces. This 'Congreve rocket' consisted of a 
new mixture of propellant and had improved aerodynamics due to an iron tube 
with a conical nose. Congreve rockets had a range of up to 5km, and were used 
by the British in the Napoleonic Wars. Both carbine ball filled rockets for 
land targets and incendiary rockets used against ships were developed. Despite 
their range and power, the Congreve rockets still had the weakness of all 
rocket weapons to date: inaccuracy.
</p>

<h5>Nebelwerfer</h5>

<p>
Nebelwerfer, meaning 'smoke mortar', were a series of German weapons developed 
in the run up to WWII. They got their name as a disinformation strategy to 
mislead observers into thinking Germany was simply producing devices to create 
smoke screens (so as not to violate the Treaty of Versailles).
</p>

<p>
They were designed with the intention of delivering poisonous gas and smoke 
shells, as well as more traditional explosive ordinance.
</p>

<h5>Katyusha (Stalin's Organ)</h5>

<p>
Built by the Soviet Union in the late 1930s, this well-known rocket artillery 
was originally designed as a cheap alternative to conventional artillery, and 
was first used in the opening month of the German invasion of the USSR, 
Operation Barbarossa. This truck-mounted 132mm launcher could fire as many as <em><b>HOW MANY?</b></em>
warheads distances of more than six miles (9 km) in 10 seconds. With the 
capability of showering vast areas with a dense hail of high explosives and 
then speeding to safety before enemy guns could even get a fix on them 
(known as ‘shoot and scoot’), the Germans feared the Katyusha. Its highly 
recognisable wailing sound when fired earned it the nickname ‘Stalin’s Organ’ 
from the Wehrmacht.
</p>

<p class='figdescription'>Fig 2: The Katyusha missile system.</p>

<p>
Based on the success of the air-to-air combat of WWI, the Katyusha was first 
designed to be fired from warplanes rather than ground vehicles. The 5 foot, 
93 pound rockets would be fired from the ground via steel racks consisting of 
multiple adjacent launch rails. The entire assembly could be bolted onto the 
back of ordinary utility trucks. The launch vehicles were known as BM-13s. It 
only took 4 such trucks to release the firepower equal to 75 field guns onto a 
1.5 square-mile patch of ground in under 30 seconds. Despite this, the weapon 
had its drawbacks, the main one being its inaccuracy. The reloading of the 
weapon was also a major issue with this sometimes taking up to an hour.
</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gcKhS7ly8ig?ecver=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>
The name ‘Katyusha’ was not the official name of the weapon, being the Russian 
equivalent of the name ‘Katie.’ Being manufactured by the ‘Voronezy Komintern’ 
plant, they often bore a large ‘K’ on the side, which troops joked stood for 
‘Katyusha’ based on the popular 1938 wartime ballad, about a woman who is 
separated from her lover during wartime.
</p>

<p>
Due to the success of the Katyusha model, many variants were subsequently made. 
Models with launchers fitted to trucks, jeeps and even tanks were constructed. 
Although seen to have only been introduced as a temporary alternative to 
conventional artillery, the Katyusha proved so successful that the Red Army 
continued to refine the design into the 1950s and 60s. A well-known descendent 
was the BM-21, commonly known as the ‘Hail,’ and could fire up to 40 128mm 
M-21 warheads in under 20 seconds. These much improved launchers had a range of 
20 km.

<p class='figdescription'>Fig 3: The BM-21 system.</p>

<h5>Patriot Missile</h5>

<p>
On 25th February 1991, 28 American soldiers were killed and a further 100 
severely injured when an Iraqi Scud missile hit the army barracks in Dahran, 
Saudi Arabia. This was due to the failure of the American Patriot Missile to 
track and intercept the Iraqi scud missile due to, as claimed by officials, a 
‘software problem.’ It was later revealed that this failed tracking attempt 
was actually down to an inaccurate calculation caused by arithmetic errors in 
the computer system, specifically in the conversion of binary and decimal 
numbers.
</p>

<img src="media/images/modernweapons/rocketry/patriot.png" alt="Patriot" width="388" height="311"/>

<p class='figdescription'>Fig 4: The Patriot missile system.</p>

<p>
The defence system consisted of an electronic detection system, known as the 
‘range gate.’ This would calculate the location at which the Patriot was to 
find and collide with a target. To calculate where the Patriot missile was to 
aim for, it would calculate its location based on the velocity of the Scud and 
the last time it was detected by the radar.
</p>

<p>
The time was saved by the computer's clock in a 24 bit binary register, and 
measured to a tenth of a second. 0.1 can not be expressed exactly in binary, 
leading to an error of 0.000000095.

<h6 id='boxtitle1'>Binary Errors(click to expand)</h6>

</div>

<p>
Any numbers that cannot be expressed as a power of two are not 
exactly expressible in binary. The number 1/10 in a 24 bit binary register is 
equivalent to the expansion:
</p>

<img src="media/images/modernweapons/rocketry/eq11.png" alt="Binomial expansion" width="253" height="43"/>

<p>
By cutting this off at 24 bits, an error of around 0.000000095 was introduced. 
Despite seeming relatively small, this had an effect on large multiplications. 
Over 100 hours, this error amounts to:
</p>

<img src="media/images/modernweapons/rocketry/eq12.png" alt="Error eq." width="187" height="18"/>

</div>

<p>
On the day of the disaster, the battery of the Patriot system had been running 
for 100 hours with no breaks. Since there are 10 clock cycles in a second, the 
inaccuracy over this time had built up to 0.34 seconds.
</p>

<p>
In this time the Scud, travelling at a speed of 1676km/h, covers over half a 
kilometre. The shift calculated in the range gate, which considered 137m to be 
out of range, came out to be 687m. This meant the Scud was not targeted and the 
Patriot system did not fire.
</p>

<h4>Physics</h4>

<h5>Newton's Laws of Motion</h5>

<p>Newton's laws of motion are:</p>

<ol>

<li>
In an inertial reference frame, an object will either remains at rest or 
continues to travel at a constant velocity unless acted on by a resultant 
force. In terms of rockets, this law explains why they move in the first place. 
Without created the propulsive force, the rocket would experience no 
acceleration, and would remain stationary.
</li>

<li>
In inertial reference frame, the vector sum of the forces, <em>F</em> on an 
object is equal to the product of its mass <em>m</em> and its acceleration 
<em>a</em>. This can also be expressed as it's rate of change of momentum. This 
will explain the amount of thrust produced by a rocket in a given time. However 
his only applies to constant mass systems.
</li>

<li>
When a body exerts a force on another body, the second body simultaneously 
exerts a force equal in magnitude but opposite in direction on the first body. 
This law explains how the expulsion of mass causes a thrusting force on the 
rocket, the 'reaction.'
</li>

</ol>

<h5>Tsiolovesky's Rocket Equation</h5>

<p>
Derived by Russian scientist Konstantin Tsiolovesky in 1903, this equation 
describes the motion of any vehicle or missile that follows the basic principle 
of rockets, being a device can self-accelerate by expelling part of its mass 
with high velocity, due to the conservation of momentum. The equation is:

<h6 id='boxtitle2'>Derivation (click to expand)</h6>

</div>

<p>
Consider a simple rocket containing all of its unburnt propellant. According to 
Newton's 2nd law, the resultant force on an object, <em>F</em> is equal to the 
product of its mass <em>m</em> and its acceleration <em>a</em>, that is:
</p>

<img src="media/images/modernweapons/rocketry/eq2.png" alt="F=ma" width="40" height="16" />

<p>
This is the equivalent of stating that the force on the object is equal to its 
rate of change in momentum <em>p</em>:
</p>

<img src="media/images/modernweapons/rocketry/eq3.png" alt="Change of momentum" width="40" height="34" />

<p>
<em>p = Mv</em> where <em>M</em> is the instantaneous mass of the rocket and 
<em>v</em> is its velocity. This means we can rewrite Newton's 2nd law as:
</p>

<img src="media/images/modernweapons/rocketry/eq4.png" alt="2nd law" width="68" height="77"/>

<p>
where <em>v<sub>e</sub></em> is the effective exhaust velocity and 
<em>m<sub>p</sub></em> is the mass of the propellant. Combining the two 
equations, we get:
</p>

<img src="media/images/modernweapons/rocketry/eq5.png" alt="diff. eq." width="113" height="48"/>

<p>
In assuming we move with the rocket, <em>v = 0</em>, so:
</p>

<img src="media/images/modernweapons/rocketry/eq6.png" alt="Mdv" width="75" height="20"/>

<p>
The mass <em>M</em> of the rocket and <em>m<sub>p</sub></em> of the propellant, 
are functions of time, that being:
</p>

<img src="media/images/modernweapons/rocketry/eq7.png" alt="M(t)" width="91" height="23"/>

<p>
Therefore, we see that:
</p>

<img src="media/images/modernweapons/rocketry/eq8.png" alt="Rocket equation" width="87" height="183"/>

</div>

<img src="media/images/modernweapons/rocketry/eq1.png" alt="Rocket equation" width="68" height="40"/>

<p>
Here, <em>&Delta;v</em> is the change in velocity, <em>v<sub>e</sub></em> is 
the exhaust velocity, <em>m<sub>i</sub></em> and <em>m<sub>f</sub></em> are 
the initial and final masses of the vehicle. The term 'ln' refers to the 
natural logarithm.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes we are more interested in the thrust created by the rocket and its 
subsequent acceleration, <em>a<sub>r</sub></em>. Expressing this acceleration 
as the derivative of <em>v<sub>r</sub></em>, we see that:
</p>

<img src="media/images/modernweapons/rocketry/eq9.png" alt="Acceleration eq." width="139" height="37"/>

<p>
where <em>M</em> is the mass flow rate. From Newton's 2nd law, the thrust 
force <em>F<sub>r</sub></em> is given by:
</p>

<img src="media/images/modernweapons/rocketry/eq10.png" alt="Fr eq." width="79" height="25"/>

<p>
This shows that a rocket creates thrust either by expelling more mass or by 
increasing the velocity of expulsion <em>v<sub>e</sub></em>. By plotting the 
rocket equation (in terms of mass ratio against the 
<em>&Delta;v/v<sub>e</sub></em> ratio) we can see an exponential relationship 
between the amount of fuel required and the desired change in velocity, 
<em>&Delta;v</em>:
