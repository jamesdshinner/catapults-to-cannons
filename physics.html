<h3>Projectile Motion</h3>

<p>
When a particle is launched at an angle, its path of flight, or trajectory, 
forms an arc shape known in mathematics as a parabola. This is due to the fact 
it is accelerated downwards by Earth’s gravitational field. The trajectory of a 
particle launched with velocity <em>u</em> at angle <em>&theta;</em> is shown 
in the diagram below:
</p>

<p class='figdescription'>
Fig 2: The horizontal and vertical components of the launch vector
</p>

<p>
The horizontal and vertical components of the initial velocity <em>u</em> are 
<em>ucos&theta;</em> and <em>usin&theta;</em> respectively. These results can 
be derived from basic trigonometry, as the velocity and its horizontal and 
vertical components can be made into a right angled triangle, as shown in the 
diagram above.
</p>

<p>
To calculate the range and height of the projectile, we must first be familiar 
with the 'SUVAT' equations. Here <em>u</em> is the initial velocity, <em>v</em> 
is the final velocity, <em>a</em> is the acceleration and <em>t</em> is the 
time taken.

<p>
With the velocity split into two components at right angles to each other, they 
are now independent of each other, the only variable in common being the time 
of flight. This very much simplifies our approach to calculate the range. In 
these calculations we will assume no air resistance.
</p>

<p>
Firstly, let’s consider the vertical velocity, as this is needed to calculate 
the time of flight. We can use the first SUVAT equation to calculate this time. 
In this case, our initial velocity will be the vertical component of <em>u</em>,
 equal to <em>ucos&theta;</em>. The particle is decelerated to 0, which is our 
final velocity <em>v</em>, as it is being decelerated by gravity, which acts in 
the downwards direction. This means we use a negative sign and <em>a=-g</em>. As 
shown in the diagram, the time in which this occurs is only in the first half 
of the trajectory. Substituting these values into the first SUVAT equation, we 
get: 
</p>

<img src="media/images/physics/projectile/eq2.png" alt="t eq." width="84" height="77"/>

<p>
Now we can consider the horizontal component. Since this is acting at 90&deg; 
to the gravitational field, no work is done, so it experiences no acceleration. 
This means that the horizontal component is constant throughout the flight 
(since we are ignoring air resistance). We can therefore use the simple 
relation distance=speed x time. The speed in this case is <em>ucos&theta;</em>, 
the horizontal component of <em>u</em>.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, using our previously derived equation for the time of flight, the 
range, <em>d</em> is given by:
</p>

<img src="media/images/physics/projectile/eq3.png" alt="d eq." width="186" height="38" />

<p>Using the double angle formula <em>2sin&theta;cos&theta;=sin2&theta;</em></p>

<img src="media/images/physics/projectile/eq4.png" alt="d eq. 2" width="68" height="39"/>

<h4>Optimum Angle for Maximum Range</h4>

<p>The maximum value a sine or cosine function can take is 1.</p>

<img src="media/images/physics/projectile/diagram3.png" alt="sine graph" width="302" height="164"/>

<p class='figdescription'>Fig 3: Maximum value of a sine function.</p>

<p>The maximum range is therefore found when:</p>

<img src="media/images/physics/projectile/eq5.png" alt="&theta; derivation" width="96" height="54"/>

<h4>Maximum Height</h4>

<p>
The maximum height, <em>h</em> reached by the projectile occurs when the 
vertical velocity component is 0. Using the 2nd SUVAT equation, we find that:
</p>

<img src="media/images/physics/projectile/eq6.png" alt="h eq." width="69" height="67"/>

<h3>Air Resistance</h3>

<p>
The SUVAT equations as stated above are only valid for motion under constant 
acceleration. This acceleration however is not possible in the real world. Air 
resistance plays a big part in the motion of particles on Earth.
</p>

<p>
It is caused by the collisions between the projectile and the molecules 
constituting the air. It is proportional to the square of the speed but works 
against the motion of the particle:
</p>

<img src="media/images/physics/airresistanceeq.png" alt="Air resistance" width="51" height="23"/>

<p>
Here, <em>k</em> is some constant dependent on the shape of the projectile and 
the density of the surrounding gas or liquid. When modelling with air 
resistance it is important to include this term as part of the forces acting on 
the projectile.
</p>

<p>
Here is a comparison of the trajectory of a projectile with and without air 
resistance:

<p class='figdescription'>

</p>

<h3>Vectors</h3>

<p>
A vector is a mathematical object that has both magnitude and direction. They 
can be visualised as arrows pointing in a direction, or as the difference 
between two points, as seen in Figure 1:
</p>

<img src="media/images/physics/vectors/vectors.png" alt="Vectors as arrows" width="370" height="370"/>

<p class='figdescription'>
Fig 5: Vectors as arrows or as the difference between two points.
</p>

<p>
They are usually denoted by an underline, whereas the magnitude or length of a 
vector is the same symbol without the underscore.
</p>

<p>
The vector <em><u>u</u></em> can be written in multiple ways, all meaning the 
same thing:
</p>

<img src="media/images/physics/vectors/eq1.png" alt="Notation of vectors" width="114" height="58"/>

<p>
The hats represent unit vectors, with length 1. One can add and subtract 
vectors, but they cannot be multiplied and divided like scalars, however other 
operations are available.
</p>

<img src="media/images/physics/vectors/vectoraddition.png" alt="Vector addition" width="349" height="284"/>

<p class='figdescription'>Fig 6: Vector addition and subtraction.</p>

<h4>The Dot Product</h4>

<p>
One operation that is exclusive to vectors is the dot product. It is defined as 
follows:
</p>

<img src="media/images/physics/vectors/eq2.png" alt="Dot product" width="152" height="62"/>

<p>Note it takes two vectors and outputs a scalar.</p>

<p>It has a second definition that is more useful for physical solutions:</p>

<img src="media/images/physics/vectors/eq3.png" alt="Dot product cosine" width="77" height="18"/>

<p>
Here <em>&theta;</em> is the angle between the two vectors. This definition can 
be used to find the magnitude of a vector:
</p>

<img src="media/images/physics/vectors/eq4.png" alt="Magnitude of a vector" width="54" height="23"/>

<h4>The Cross Product</h4>

<p>
Otherwise known as the vector product, the cross product takes two vectors and 
outputs another vector. It is defined as:
</p>

<img src="media/images/physics/vectors/eq5.png" alt="Cross product" width="159" height="60"/>

<p>
The unit vector in the <em><u>n</u></em> direction is perpendicular to the 
plane formed by vectors <em><u>u</u></em> and <em><u>v</u></em> as shown by 
Figure 7:
</p>

<img src="media/images/physics/vectors/crossproduct.png" alt="Cross product diagram" width="464" height="362"/>

<p class='figdescription'>Fig 7: A visualisation of the cross product.</p>

<h3>Rotational Motion</h3>

<h4>
Polar Coordinates
</h4>

<p>
It makes very little sense to describe the motion of an object travelling 
around the circumference of a circle in Cartesian coordinates. An appropriate coordinate transform can be performed so that much 
more natural units are used.
</p>

<p>
Take an arbitrary circle of radius <em>r</em>. Any point on that circle can 
be described by the angle subtended from the x-axis as in Fig 8:
</p>

<img src="media/images/physics/rotational/circlediagram.png" alt="circlediagram" width="686" height="536"/>

<p class='figdescription'>Fig 8: Marking points on a circle with an angle.</p>

<p>However, if <em>&theta;</em> were held constant, one could describe every 
point on a straight line by varying the radius of the circle. Thus, it is 
possible to describe every point on a two-dimensional plane via the coordinates 
<em>r</em> and <em>&theta;</em>. These are polar coordinates. They transform to 
Cartesian coordinates by the following rules:
</p>

<img src="media/images/physics/rotational/eq1.png" alt="Polar-Cartesian transforms" width="55" height="39"/>

<p>
It is important to define the units of the angular coordinates here, as a 
careful choice leads to some useful relationships. A radian is defined as the 
angle that sweeps out the portion of the circumference that is equal in length 
to the radius of the circle.
</p>

<img src="media/images/physics/rotational/radiandiagram.png" alt="Radian diagram" width="377" height="398"/>

<p class='figdescription'>Fig 9: A radian.</p>

<p>This definition gives the following result:</p>

<img src="media/images/physics/rotational/eq2.png" alt="s=r&theta;" width="41" height="19"/>

<h4>Angular Velocity and Acceleration</h4>

<p>
Just as in linear dynamics, angular dynamics has notions of both velocity and 
acceleration. First it is important to note the difference between tangential 
and radial components. As in linear motion, one can decompose these vectors 
into two components that are perpendicular to each other. The radial component 
points outwards from the centre of the circle and the tangential component lies 
tangent to the circumference. These are considered to be in the <em>r</em> and 
<em>&theta;</em> directions respectively.
</p>

<img src="media/images/physics/rotational/circlevectordiagram.png" alt="Vector components" width="289" height="275"/>

<p class='figdescription'>Fig 10: The angular components of a vector.</p>

<p>
Clearly the <em>&theta;</em> direction changes as the vector is moved around 
the circle, hence it's direction is defined using the right-hand rule. Thus, in 
Figure 10, the <em>&theta;</em> directional vector points out of the screen 
towards the reader.
</p>

<p>
Now consider an object moving with speed <em>v</em> on a circular path. In 
polar coordinates, this particle is moving with a constant tangential velocity 
vector, but has a stationary velocity radial component. Using the relation 
between arc lengths and angle, this velocity vector can be expressed as 
follows:
</p>

<img src="media/images/physics/rotational/eq3.png" alt="Tangential velocity" width="113" height="34" />

<p>
This <em><u>&omega;</u></em> is the angular velocity of the object and is 
defined as the rate of change of the angle swept out by the object.
</p>

<p>
The next logical step is to define the acceleration of an object on a circular 
path. Considering the same example as above, the angular acceleration, 
<em><u>&alpha;</u></em>, is defined as the rate of change of the angular 
velocity:
</p>

<img src="media/images/physics/rotational/eq4.png" alt="Angular velocity" width="110" height="36"/>

<p>
Here, <em><u>a</u></em> is the tangential component of the object's 
acceleration.
</p>

<p>
This object also has another acceleration, causing the circular motion. 
Acceleration is defined as the rate of change of velocity, so change in 
direction is a result of an acceleration. The acceleration causing this motion 
is known as centripetal acceleration.
</p>

<p>
Using the same system, consider the change in direction of two velocity vectors 
after time interval <em>&Delta;t</em>. This interval is small enough such that 
the arc length swept out by the object can be taken to be a straight line:
</p>

<img src="media/images/physics/rotational/velocitychangediagram.png" alt="Velocity change diagram" width="512" height="336"/>

<p class='figdescription'>
Fig 11: The change in velocity of an object moving along a circular path at a 
constant speed.
</p>

<p>
The triangle formed by the vectors <em><u>v</u><sub>1</sub></em>, 
<em><u>v</u><sub>2</sub></em> and <em><u>v</u><sub>2</sub></em> - 
<em><u>v</u><sub>1</sub></em> is similar to the triangle formed by the radius 
of the circle on two sides and the arc length swept out <em>&Delta;s</em>, see 
Fig 11. This gives the following relation:
</p>

<img src="media/images/physics/rotational/eq5.png" alt="v-s relationship" width="57" height="34"/>

<p>
The magnitude of the average acceleration is therefore:
</p>

<img src="media/images/physics/rotational/eq6.png" alt="average acceleration eq." width="96" height="44"/>

<p>
Taking the limit as <em>&Delta;t &rarr; 0</em>, the magnitude of the 
instantaneous radial acceleration or centripetal acceleration is;
</p>

<img src="media/images/physics/rotational/eq7.png" alt="instantaneous acceleration eq." width="140" height="36" />

<p>
Now that both the radial and tangential components of the object are known, the 
total acceleration for an object in circular motion can be calculated:
</p>

<img src="media/images/physics/rotational/eq8.png" alt="total acceleration eq." width="218" height="37"/>

<h4>Moments of Inertia</h4>

<p>
Now that analogues for speed and acceleration have been defined in the 
rotational world, some analogue of mass is needed to find energies and momenta. 
Such a quantity is known as the moment of inertia, <em>I</em>:
</p>

<img src="media/images/physics/rotational/eq9.png" alt="moment of inertia" width="61" height="29" />

<p>Here, <em>dm</em> is some mass element at distance <em>r</em> from the axis 
of rotation.
</p>

<p>For some objects it may be easier to express this definition in terms of the 
density, <em>&rho;</em>.
</p>

<img src="media/images/physics/rotational/eq22.png" alt="Inertia density eq." width="64" height="33"/>

<h4>Example: A Rotating Rod</h4>

<p>Take a cylindrical rod of length <em>l</em> rotating about its endpoint:</p>

<img src="media/images/physics/rotational/rotatingrod.png" alt="rotating rod" width="327" height="327"/>

<p>Fig 11: A rotating rod.</p>

<p>Here <em>dm</em> is given by:

<img src="media/images/physics/rotational/eq10.png" alt="dm eq." width="72" height="36"/>

<p>where <em>M</em> is the total mass of the rod and the coordinate <em>r</em> 
is the distance from the axis of rotation. Using the definition:
</p>

<img src="media/images/physics/rotational/eq11.png" alt="I eq." width="113" height="36"/>

<h4>Angular Momentum, Angular Kinetic Energy and Torque</h4>

<p>
In linear dynamics, both the laws of conservation of momentum and conservation 
of energy are used to great extent and success in modelling motion. Similar 
conservation laws apply in rotating bodies too.
</p>

<p>
Angular kinetic energy is defined in exactly the same way as in linear 
dynamics, but using rotational analogues:
</p>

<img src="media/images/physics/rotational/eq12.png" alt="K=I&omega;^2" width="48" height="17" />

<p>
The kinetic energy can be combined with translational kinetic energy for a body 
rotating about its centre of mass, such that the total kinetic energy of a body 
in this motion is given by:
</p>

<img src="media/images/physics/rotational/eq13.png" alt="total kinetic eq." width="117" height="36" />

<p>Angular momentum is more complex. It is defined using the cross product 
(see vectors above). For a particle moving with linear momentum <em><u>p</u></em> at a 
position from the axis of rotation defined by the vector <em><u>r</u></em>, the 
angular momentum is:
</p>

<img src="media/images/physics/rotational/eq14.png" alt="L eq." width="49" height="18"/>

<p>
(One can also define the angular velocity of an object moving with velocity 
<em><u>v</u></em> relative to an observer as <em><u>r</u>x<u>v</u></em>. The 
acceleration can be defined similarly.
</p>

<p>
To calculate the angular momentum of a rotating body about an axis, one would 
have to sum the angular momenta of each element of mass. However, this procedure
 is contained within the definition of a moment of inertia, thus the angular 
 momentum of a rigid rotating body is given by:
</p>

<img src="media/images/physics/rotational/eq15.png" alt="L=Iw" width="41" height="18"/>

<p>
Torque is the rotational analogue of a force. It causes rotational acceleration,
 &alpha;. It is also defined using the cross product:
</p>

<img src="media/images/physics/rotational/eq16.png" alt="torque eq." width="52" height="16"/>

<p>One can use Newton's 2nd law of motion to develop a rotational analogue:</p>

<img src="media/images/physics/rotational/eq17.png" alt="2nd law eq." width="159" height="36"/>

<p>
For a rigid rotating body one simply uses the above equation in combination 
with the expression for angular momentum to find how torque relates to the motion of the body:
</p>

<img src="media/images/physics/rotational/eq18.png" alt="T=I&alpha;" width="122" height="37"/>

<h4>Work Done and Power</h4>

<p>
In keeping with tying each quantity back to its linear analogue, work done is 
still considered to be a force moved through a distance. However, the ‘force’ 
and ‘distance’ quantities are just the rotational analogues. Thus, the 
rotational work done is given by:
</p>

<img src="media/images/physics/rotational/eq19.png" alt="Work eq." width="59" height="27"/>

<p>
Power is simply the rate of change of work done,
</p>

<img src="media/images/physics/rotational/eq20.png" alt="Power eq." width="52" height="34"/>

<p>
For a constant torque, this can be expressed as:
</p>

<img src="media/images/physics/rotational/eq21.png" alt="P=&Tau;&omega;" width="106" height="32"/>
