<h3>Trebuchets</h3>

<h4>History</h4>

<p>Compared to other catapults that preceded them, trebuchets were more 
accurate. They also launched projectiles with a lower trajectory and greater 
velocity, so were ideal for damaging walls rather than hurling missiles over 
them.</p>

<p>
The first recorded trebuchets were invented in China around 300BC. These 
were traction trebuchets, where the energy required to propel the projectile 
was provided directly by a large group of men pulling down on ropes.
</p>

<p class='figdescription'>Fig 1: A traction trebuchet.</p>

<p>
The first records of the more famous counterweight trebuchet come from 12th 
century sources from Arabia and Byzantium. The new invention played a large 
role in the crusades and at the siege of Dover in 1217.
</p>

<p class='figdescription'>Fig 2: A counterweight trebuchet.</p>

<p>
During the siege of Stirling Castle in 1304, King Edward I ordered the creation 
of a trebuchet that was to be named Warwolf, believed to be the largest 
counterweight trebuchet ever built. It stood at between and 300 and 400 feet 
(that's somewhere between 150-200% the height of Durham cathedral!) and could 
hurl missiles weighing up to 300 pounds at 120mph. The sight of this behemoth 
under construction was enough to cause the Scots to try and surrender, although 
the siege went ahead and the weapon proceeded to level a large section of the 
external wall.
</p>

<h4>Physics</h4>

<p>
The counterweight trebuchet is described as a compound machine (meaning a 
combination of smaller simple machines working together). The energy of the 
projectile came from gravity. Potential energy would be stored by means of an 
extremely heavyweight box attached to the counterweight portion of the throwing 
arm by a hinged connection.
</p>

<p>Here is a trebuchet in action:</p>

<p>
In order to fire the trebuchet, the heavyweight box would be released and would 
fall under the force of gravity. This force on the weight causes rotational 
motion in the throwing arm around the axle. The arm connected to the sling is 
considerably longer than the counterweight arm. This increased the acceleration 
transmitted to the throwing portion of the arm and hence the sling. The sling 
contains the missile, passing onto it the forces generated in the lever arm. It 
alters the trajectory so that, once released, the projectile is traveling at 
the optimum angle and velocity to maximise the range.

<p class='figdescription'>Fig 4: Diagram showing the angles on a trebuchet</p>

<p>
The basic function of the trebuchet is to convert potential energy into 
kinetic energy. From the physics of projectile motion, we can deduce the range 
<em>R</em> of a projectile launched with velocity <em>u</em> at angle 
<em>&theta;</em>:
</p>

<img src="media/images/catapults/eq16.png" alt="trebuchet range" width="96" height="38"/>

<p>From this we can derive that the maximum range of trebuchet is given by:</p>

<img src="media/images/catapults/eq17.png" alt="max range" width="71" height="32"/>

<p>
where <em>M</em> is the mass of the counterweight and <em>m</em> is the mass of the 
projectile.
</p>

<p>
The most important factor in the firing of a trebuchet is the timing at which 
the control mechanism is released at the desired angle, as in the time at which 
&psi; = &phi;. For this calculation we assume that the structure is totally 
fixed to the ground, all the contacts are well lubricated (frictionless), and 
that the mass of the beam is negligible. For simplicity, we will treat this as 
a trebuchet with the counterweight connected directly to the arm.

<h6 id='boxtitle1'>Lagrangian Mechanics (click to expand)</h6>

</div>

<p>
First, we denote kinetic energy <em>T</em> and potential energy <em>V</em>. The 
Lagrangian, <em>L</em>, is then given by:
</p>

<img src="media/images/catapults/eq18.png" alt="Lagrangian eq." width="46" height="17"/>

<p>
Once we know the Lagrangian, we can use the Euler-Lagrange equation to find a 
solution describing the motion of a system. For each individual coordinate, 
denoted <em>c<sub>i</sub></em>, the Euler-Lagrange equation is:
</p>

<img src="media/images/catapults/eq19.png" alt="E-L eq." width="90" height="40" />

<p>
Note that the symbol <em>&part;</em> is used instead of <em>d</em>. This is a 
partial derivative, we are differentiating a multivariate function with respect 
to only one variable.
</p>

<p>
As an example, let's consider a simple pendulum:
</p>

<img src="media/images/catapults/diagram5.png" alt="pendulum diagram" width="88" height="200"/>

<p class='figdescription'>Fig 5: A simple pendulum.

<p>
The kinetic and potential energy are given by:
</p>

<img src="media/images/catapults/eq20.png" alt="T & V" width="92" height="62"/>

<p>
The Lagrangian is therefore given by:
</p>

<img src="media/images/catapults/eq21.png" alt="L" width="138" height="34"/>

<p>
Substituting this into the Euler-Lagrange equation gives us the solution to the 
pendulum's motion:
</p>

<img src="media/images/catapults/eq22.png" alt="Motion eq." width="72" height="29"/>

<p>Now we'll apply this to the counterweight trebuchet.<p>

<p>
Firstly, we must resolve and differentiate the cartesian and polar coordinates 
in terms of the two angles, <em>&theta;</em> and <em>&phi;</em>, as shown in 
Figure 4 above:
</p>

<img src="media/images/catapults/eq23.png" alt="Counterweight coordinates" width="95" height="105"/>

<br />
<br />

<img src="media/images/catapults/eq24.png" alt="Projectile coordinates" width="238" height="132"/>

<p>
By substituting these expressions into the cartesian expressions for kinetic 
and potential energy, we get the following equations:
</p>

<img src="media/images/catapults/eq25.png" alt="T & V" width="175" height="53"/>

<p>
From the diagram we can see that the initial conditions for the two angles, 
<em>&theta;<sub>0</sub></em> and <em>&phi;<sub>0</sub></em>, are given by:
</p>

<img src="media/images/catapults/eq26.png" alt="Initial conditions" width="78" height="78"/>

<p>Substituting these into the Euler-Lagrange equations (too complicated even for 
a WARNING:MATHS box) yields a 4th order differential equation that has to be 
solved numerically.</p>

</div>

<p>To understand the mechanics of trebuchets, we must use 
Lagrangian mechanics.The solution is a complicated differential equation, but 
the resulting motion is shown in the diagram below: </p>
