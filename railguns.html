<h3>Railguns</h3>

<h4>History</h4>

<p>
The earliest form of a railgun dates back to 1918 when French inventor Louis 
Octave Fauchon-Villeplee developed a cannon that used electromagnetic forces to 
fire a projectile. The first theoretically viable railgun (one which could be 
used in battle) was proposed by the research team of Nazi Germany during the 
second world war. It produced a muzzle velocity of 2000 m/s using a projectile 
of explosives weighing 0.5 kg.

<p class='figdescription'>
Fig 1: The schematic of the German railgun.
</p>

<p>
After the war ended and all of Nazi Germany’s secrets were lain bare, many 
scientists took interest in the field. Throughout the middle of the century 
work was done in engineering motors that could power such weapons as it was 
stated in a 1947 report that the power required for such a weapon was 
equivalent to that required to power half of the city of Chicago.
</p>

<p>
In recent years, the US military have pioneered this field and have recently 
installed such weapons on some battleships, most notably the Zumwalt class 
destroyer. The weapon can reportedly fire a 3.2kg projectile at 2.4 kilometres 
per second, with a maximum range of over 100 nautical miles.

<p>
This weapon is at the cutting edge of military technology and it is still in 
its early stages of development and has not yet reached its maximum 
capabilities.
</p>

<p>Here it is in action:</p>

<h3>Physics</h3>

<h4>The Process</h4>

<p>
In its most basic form, the railgun is comprised of two long rails connected by 
a projectile. The rails have current running through them in opposite 
directions such that the projectile also has a current running through it. 
These currents create a magnetic field that drives the projectile along the 
rails, propelling it at high speeds out of the ‘barrel’. Figure 1 displays this 
process below:
</p>

<p class='figdescription'>Fig 3: The overview of a railgun.</p>

<h4>Amp&egrave;re's Law (Maxwell's Fourth Equation)</h4>

<p>
The Maxwell equations are a set of four equations that simply describe all 
electromagnetic interactions and processes that occur in the universe. They 
have stood the test of time and experiment. In fact they even inspired research 
into the field of relativity by Einstein. However, Maxwell did not find 
the equations himself. Rather, he collated the four equations and wrote them 
down in a manner that meant that they were consistent with each other. The 
last of the equations was discovered by Andr&eacute;-Marie Amp&egrave;re. In 
its most general form it is:
</p>

<img src="media/images/modernweapons/railguns/eq1.png" alt="Amp&egrave;re's law" width="120" height="39"/>

<p>
Here <em><u>B</u></em> is the magnetic field, <em><u>J</u></em> is the current 
density, <em><u>E</u></em> is the electric field and the greek letters are just 
fundamental constants. This equation states that the magnetic field around a 
closed loop is proportional to the current and the rate of change of electric 
field through the loop. This is clearer if we show it in its integral form:
</p>

<div class='maths' id='maths1'>

<img id='rightskull' src="media/images/skull.png" alt="skull" height="100%"/>

<h6 id='boxtitle1'>Integral Form (click to expand)</h6>

</div>

<p>
If both sides are integrated with respect to a surface 
<em><u>S</u></em>. Then the following is obtained:
</p>

<p>
The lefthand side can be rewritten using Stokes' theorem that states that:
</p>

<img src="media/images/modernweapons/railguns/eq2.png" alt="Stokes' thm." width="123" height="38"/>

<p>
The righthand side is the line integral of the magnetic field around the 
boundary of <em>S</em>, <em>&part;S</em>. Thus, in integral form, Maxwell's 
fourth equation is:
</p>

<img src="media/images/modernweapons/railguns/eq3.png" alt="MIV IF" width="188" height="39"/>

</div>

<img src="media/images/modernweapons/railguns/eq3.png" alt="MIV IF" width="188" height="39"/>

<p>
Take an infinitely long wire with current <em><u>I</u></em>. 
The equation above states that a magnetic field is produced in a closed loop 
around the wire. See Figure 4:
</p>

<img src="media/images/modernweapons/railguns/wirefield.png" alt="Wire field diagram" width="307" height="351"/>

<p class='figdescription'>
Fig 4: The magnetic field produced by a wire.
</p>

<p>
The law also describes the magnetic field produced produced by a capacitor 
(two parallel plates with opposing charge densities.)
</p>

<img src="media/images/modernweapons/railguns/capacitor.png" alt="Capacitor diagram" width="571" height="243"/>

<p class='figdescription'>
Fig 5: A capacitor.
</p>

<p>
As the current flows into one side of the capacitor, the total charge on the 
plate increases, increasing the electric field applied to the other plate. This 
change in electric field over time produces a magnetic field as described by 
the last term in Maxwell 4.
</p>

<p>
This law is useful in describing the magnetic field produced by the ‘rails’ of 
the railgun. Each rail of the railgun carries a constant current of <em>I</em> 
amps, but in opposite directions. There is no change in the electric field in 
the wire thus the last term of Maxwell’s fourth equation disappears.
</p>

<img src="media/images/modernweapons/railguns/eq4.png" alt="M IV without final term" width="153" height="47"/>

<p>
Now choose the path as a circular loop of radius <em>r</em> that encloses only 
one of the rails and lies perpendicular to the rail.
</p>

<img src="media/images/modernweapons/railguns/looppath.png" alt="Path diagram" width="352" height="353"/>

<p class='figdescription'>
Fig 6: Imaginary loop around one of the rails. The shape of the cross section 
of the rail enclosed is irrelevant to the final result.
</p>

<p>The right-hand integral is 
simply the current enclosed by the loop since it is the sum of the product of 
the current per unit and some small element of area:
</p>

<img src="media/images/modernweapons/railguns/eq5.png" alt="Enclosed current" width="87" height="37"/>

<p>
This result is true for any current or sum of currents through a closed loop. 
Now to evaluate the left-hand side of the equation. The loop has been carefully 
chosen such that the magnetic field always lies tangent. Thus, since the loop 
is a circle:
</p>

<img src="media/images/modernweapons/railguns/eq6.png" alt="Bdl eq." width="122" height="35"/>

<p>
So the direction of the magnetic field produced by a wire is given by the 
right-hand rule and the magnitude at distance <em>r</em> is given by:
</p>

<img src="media/images/modernweapons/railguns/eq7.png" alt="Final eq." width="53" height="36"/>

<h4>The Lorentz Force</h4>

<p>
The Lorentz force describes the force experienced by a moving charged particle 
through an electric and magnetic field. For a particle of charge <em>q</em> 
moving with velocity <em><u>v</u></em>, the force exerted by the fields is:
</p>

<img src="media/images/modernweapons/railguns/eq8.png" alt="Lorentz force" width="89" height="22"/>

<p>
Take the case of a constant current flowing along a wire in a constant magnetic 
field. Consider only the magnetic field, as the electric field is what causes 
the current to flow. Thus, the force on each electron is:
</p>

<img src="media/images/modernweapons/railguns/eq9.png" alt="Force on electrons" width="73" height="21"/>

<p>
Where <em><u>v</u></em> is the drift velocity of each electron (it is actually 
an average, but in this case can be taken to be equivalent for all electrons.) 
For each section of wire <em>dl</em> of cross-sectional area <em>A</em>, the 
total force that acts upon it is the sum of the forces acting upon all the 
electrons contained within it. Assume that there is a constant number of 
electrons per volume <em>n</em>, then the number of electrons within the volume 
is:
</p>

<img src="media/images/modernweapons/railguns/eq10.png" alt="Electrons per volume" width="51" height="20"/>

<p>
Thus the force experienced by a section of the wire can be written as:
</p>

<img src="media/images/modernweapons/railguns/eq11.png" alt="Force eq." width="228" height="20"/>

<p>
These expressions are obtained using the definition of current density.
</p>

<p>
In the railgun, the current that moves through the magnetic field is the 
current in the projectile. For clarity, take the following coordinate system:
</p>

<img src="media/images/modernweapons/railguns/coordinates.png" alt="Coordinate system" width="744" height="356"/>

<p class='figdescription'>
Fig 7: The coordinate system used to describe the railgun.
</p>

<p>
In this system the rails are parallel to the x-axis and the projectile is 
parallel to the y-axis. Assume that at the moment the current is turned on, the 
rails and the projectile have current <em>I<sub>0</sub></em>, which flows in 
the positive y direction along the projectile.
</p>

<p>
In this case the 'wire' is always perpendicular to the magnetic field generated 
by the current through the rails, so the force on some small section of the 
projectile is:
</p>

<img src="media/images/modernweapons/railguns/eq12.png" alt="Force element" width="67" height="21"/>

<p>
Now assume that the rails have width <em>2R</em> such that in the coordinate 
system previously defined, a projectile of length <em>L</em> begins at 
<em>y = R</em> and ends at <em>y = L + R</em>:
</p>

<img src="media/images/modernweapons/railguns/crosssection.png" alt="Cross section" width="568" height="312"/>

<p class='figdescription'>
Fig 8: The cross-section of a railgun with the assumed coordinate system.
</p>

<p>
Inserting the expression calculated for the magnetic field due to the current 
in the rails into the equation for the force on some small element of the 
projectile one obtains an expression to calculate the total force on the 
projectile (It is assumed that the projectile is narrow enough that the 
magnetic field does not change direction along its width):
</p>

<img src="media/images/modernweapons/railguns/eq13.png" alt="Force element" width="" height=""/>

<p>
This expression combines the field from both rails. Now simply integrate to 
calculate the total force on the projectile at the moment the current is 
turned on:
</p>

<img src="media/images/modernweapons/railguns/eq14.png" alt="total force" width="256" height="37"/>

<h4>Back EMF</h4>

<p>
As shown above a charged particle moving in a magnetic field experiences a 
force. Consider a wire experiencing this force:
</p>

<img src="media/images/modernweapons/railguns/forcefield.png" alt="Force field" width="321" height="370" />

<p class='figdescription'>
Fig 9: The Lorentz force on a wire in a uniform magnetic field.
</p>

<p>
The wire is forced to the left. This causes the electrons in the wire to have 
some velocity in the left-hand direction. Using the right-hand rule with this 
new velocity and the magnetic field there is now a force on the electrons 
pointing downwards! This is called a back electromotive force and works to 
reduce the current in the wire. This is the mathematical form of Lenz’s Law:
</p>

<p>
<em>The direction of any magnetic induction effect is such as to oppose the 
cause of the field.</em>
</p>

<p>The equation describing the motion is found to be:</p>

<div class='maths' id='maths2'>

<div id='titlebar' onclick=change2()>

<img id='leftskull' src="media/images/skull.png" alt="skull" height="100%"/>

<img id='rightskull' src="media/images/skull.png" alt="skull" height="100%"/>

<h6 id='boxtitle2'>Solution Derivation (click to expand)</h6>

</div>

<p>
Using the Lorentz force for the case of the moving projectile, one 
finds that the force on the electrons is:
</p>

<img src="media/images/modernweapons/railguns/eq15.png" alt="Force on electrons" width="79" height="26"/>

<p>Thus the electric field on an electron is:</p>

<img src="media/images/modernweapons/railguns/eq16.png" alt="Electric field" width="71" height="22"/>

<p>
Using the system as shown in Figure 5 the electric field at a point y is given 
by:
</p>

<img src="media/images/modernweapons/railguns/eq17.png" alt="E field at a point" width="171" height="39" />

<p>
Thus, the potential across the projectile is:
</p>

<img src="media/images/modernweapons/railguns/eq18.png" alt="Potential" width="218" height="74"/>

<p>
Now assume that the resistance of the circuit is &gamma; when the projectile is 
positioned at <em>x = 0</em>. Also assume that the rails have linear 
resistivity &phi;. Then the total resistance of the loop at some point 
<em>x</em> is:
</p>

<img src="media/images/modernweapons/railguns/eq19.png" alt="Resistance" width="67" height="28"/>

<p>Using Ohm's law the current produced by the moving projectile is:</p>

<img src="media/images/modernweapons/railguns/eq20.png" alt=" Projectile current" width="125" height="39"/>

<p>
By adding this term to the current, one can model how the current around the 
loop varies as the projectile moves. Since they are in opposite directions, 
<em>I<sub>p</sub></em> picks up a negative sign:
</p>

<img src="media/images/modernweapons/railguns/eq21.png" alt="Total current" width="188" height="40"/>

<p>
Now that the current has been modelled, we can also model the force. Using the 
equation derived previously for the force experienced with a constant current, but 
replacing the current with the new model one finds that the force experienced 
is:
</p>

<img src="media/images/modernweapons/railguns/eq22.png" alt="Force" width="228" height="43"/>

<p>
This equation is obviously very difficult to solve analytically, so numerical 
methods shall be adopted. It is a second order non-linear differential equation 
of the form:
</p>

<img src="media/images/modernweapons/railguns/eq23.gif" alt="Diff. Eq." width="136" height="49"/>

<p>where <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, <em>c</em> and <em>d</em> are constants.</p>

</div>

<img src="media/images/modernweapons/railguns/eq23.gif" alt="Diff. Eq." width="136" height="49"/>

<p>where <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, <em>c</em> and <em>d</em> are constants.</p>

<p>
The resulting motion of the particle from this back EMF is shown in Figure 7:

<p class='figdescription'>
Fig 10: The position and speed of a projectile in a railgun.
</p>

<p>
Note that the speed does not seem to tail off. This is because air resistance 
has been ignored. Thus in this model, the longer the railgun is, the larger the 
muzzle velocity. With air resistance taken into account, this is not the case, 
and a terminal velocity can be seen to be present:
