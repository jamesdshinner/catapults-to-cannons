# catapults-to-cannons

This repository contains the website source code for the science communication project 'Catapults to Cannons: Projectile Motion Through History', created for the Physics in Society undergraduate physics at Durham University in 2016.

The website is intended to educate A-level physics students on the use of projectile motion in warfare through history, detailing the inventions of various weapons and the physics of the guiding principles behind their operation. It accomplishes this through the medium of text, images, videos, animations and an interactive quiz.

The project can be viewed at https://jamesdshinner.github.io/catapults-to-cannons/.
