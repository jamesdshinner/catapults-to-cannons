<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
This website is intended to act as an overview of projectile motion and its
uses throughout the history of warfare. Projectile weapons have served as a 
cornerstone of military arsenals since their conception, adding strategic and 
tactical dimensions to war.
</p>

<p>
In the physics section, we cover the fundamental laws governing the motion 
of all projectiles, as applicable to the modern weapons of today and tomorrow 
as to the ballistic weapons of classical Greece and Rome. This includes an 
overview of the SUVAT equations of Newtonian mechanics, an introduction to the 
concept of vectors, and a look at the physics of rotational motion.

Wherever you see these boxes, you'll find the more advanced maths in the 
project. The majority of the content is accessible without getting too 
technical, but these sections go further for those who aren't afraid to get 
their hands dirty.
</p>

<p>
We trace the development of projectile weapons from the earliest inventions of 
the ancient Greeks, from whom we get the term catapult. We look at the further 
developments to ballistic weapons through to the middle ages, when the 
trebuchet ruled the battlefield. We then take a look at the invention of 
gunpowder and how the introduction of cannon revolutionised the field and 
became the projectile weapons of choice for the armies of the world over the 
next few hundred years. Finally, we take a look at the developments of rocket 
weapons over the past century, as well as the electromagnetic railguns at the 
forefront of current military arsenals. In each section, we take a look at the 
historical development of the weapons, as well as the physics underlying the 
different methods of propulsion.

All of these different sections can be accessed by clicking on the links below 
to navigate around the site. You can also find a quiz to test your knowledge of 
the content that is covered, a conclusion with a comparison of the different 
powers and ranges of the weaponry throughout time, and a page of references with
 citations of all material used to put together the website.
