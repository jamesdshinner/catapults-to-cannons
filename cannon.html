<h3>Cannon</h3>

<h4>History</h4>

<p>The previous section was concerned solely with mechanical weapons that
 launched projectiles by transferring energy from a spring potential or 
 gravitational potential to kinetic energy in the projectile. It is possible to 
 find other forms of potential energy to release, in order to effect motion. 
 Chemical potential energy is the energy stored in the bonds of molecules that 
 can be released through chemical reactions. One such mixture of molecules that 
 releases large amounts of energy is gunpowder.</p>
 
<p>
As early as the 8th century Chinese alchemists discovered an early form of 
gunpowder quite by chance, during their search for the elixir of life. Their 
inventory of ingredients contained a plethora of substances including two key 
components of gunpowder: sulphur and saltpetre (potassium nitrate as it would 
be known to modern scientists). Whilst conducting some experiments they 
chanced on the fact that a certain mixture of sulphur and saltpetre would 
combust quite spectacularly when subjected to heat. Eventually, through much 
experimentation, the final key ingredient, charcoal (or carbon), was added to 
the mixture, thus completing the creation of gunpowder, though the proportions 
were to be adjusted throughout history.
</p>

<p class='figdescription'>Fig 1: Modern day gunpowder.</p>

<p>
Through modern methods, scientists have been able to obtain the ideal 
proportions for the three vital ingredients, with the right amount of moisture 
for the ideal burning time; 75.7% potassium nitrate, 11.7% charcoal, 9.7% 
sulphur and 2.9% water. This leads to the chemical equation:
</p>

<img src="media/images/cannons/eq1.png" alt="chemical equation" width="695" height="139"/>

<p>
This reaction releases 3.0 megajoules per kilogram of reactant. Obviously, this 
is quite a complicated reaction in terms of the chemical processes, however 
there are two key ideas to investigate. Firstly, that this is an exothermic 
reaction; It is a reaction that releases energy to its surroundings, and that 
some of these compounds form gases.
</p>

<p>
The Chinese soon realised that the energy released by this mixture could be 
harnessed for military technology. They developed weapons such as fire-lances, 
which were tubes filled with gunpowder that would act as flame throwers once 
the gunpowder was ignited. Eventually shrapnel was used in tandem for extra 
effect and then cannonballs were introduced. The oldest surviving gun dates 
back to 1288, but the first documented use of gunpowder artillery on the 
battlefield was on 28th January 1132.
</p>

<img src="media/images/cannons/firelance.png" alt="Fire-lance" width="477" height="276"/>

<p class='figdescription'>Fig 2: A mosaic depicting the use of a fire-lance.</p>

<p>
In 1260 cannon were used against the Mongols by the Mamluks in the 
battle of Ain Jalut. This is claimed to have been the first use of gunpowder 
with proportions almost the exactly same as those for the ‘ideal’ reaction.
</p>

<p>
The first skilled use of gunpowder in Northern Europe came from the Franciscan 
monk Roger Bacon. He was well educated in many fields at Oxford University and 
spent time in Paris gaining a doctorate. His key addition to the history of 
gunpowder was the purification of potassium nitrate. After some time, he 
decided that the best weighting to have would be 37.5% saltpetre, 31.25% 
sulphur and 31.25% charcoal. This postulation led to 10 years of imprisonment 
after the church discovered what their monks were getting up to!
</p>

<p>
The first metal cannon seen in medieval Europe was the pot-de-fer. It fired an 
arrow-like bolt and was set off through a touch hole with a heated wire. It was 
used by both the French and the English during the Hundred Years’ War. Further 
advancements were made by the both the Byzantine and Ottoman Empire.
</p>

<img src="media/images/cannons/potdefer.png" alt="Pot de fer" width="489" height="229"/>

<p class='figdescription'>Fig 3: A pot-de-fer.</p>

<p>
By this time cannon had both use as a siege engine and as field artillery. In 
order to defend from cannon the design of fortifications changed drastically 
from the high towers and ramparts of castle to the sloped walls of star forts. 
These changes signalled the redundancy of earlier siege engines such as 
trebuchets.
</p>

<p class='figdescription'>

</p>

<p>
By the mid-sixteenth century the variety of cannon in use was so great that 
European monarchs began to classify them for clarity. Wheeled gun carriages had 
become commonplace allowing for more mobility on the battlefield. Tactics 
changed, favouring the use of larger amounts of smaller calibre cannon that 
could fire more rapidly.
</p>

<p>
In the nineteenth century, military leaders placed greater importance on the 
long-range accuracy of cannon. This can be seen in the cannon used in the 
American Civil War. The American 3 howitzer had a range of over 1.8km and the 
12 pounder Napoleon had a range of over 1.5km. Cannon were integral in 
Napoleon’s rise to power and dominance on the battlefield.
</p>

<p class='figdescription'>

</p>

<p>
In the modern day world cannon are still used by the military, though the 
projectiles launched and the substances reacted to provide the energy required 
are very different to the gunpowder and cannonball used in the days of 
Napoleon. One such cannon is the M198 howitzer used by the US military, which 
is favoured as it is easily towed and inexpensive to run.
</p>

<h4>Physics</h4>

<p>
A cannonball is fired from a cannon by making use of a pressure difference 
across the cannonball created by the energy released in the reaction of 
gunpowder. A cannon is essentially a tube with one open end containing some 
gunpowder situated between the closed end of the tube and a cannonball:
</p>

<img src="media/images/cannons/cannondiagram.jpg" alt="Cannon diagram" width="416" height="250"/>

<p class='figdescription'>Fig 6: An example of a cannon prior to ignition.</p>

<h5>Potential Barriers</h5>

<p>
The first part of the process to investigate is to see how the energy is 
released from the gunpowder. It is an exothermic reaction, meaning that the net 
result of the reaction is a release of energy, however energy is required to 
start the reaction. This is a result of potential barriers, 
as illustrated in the figure below:
</p>

<img src="media/images/cannons/potentialgraph.png" alt="potential barrier graph" width="592" height="447"/>

<p class='figdescription'>
Fig 7: The varying of the potential energy in molecular bonds as an 
exothermic reaction takes place.
</p>

<p>
<em>A</em> represents the ground state energy stored in the bonds of the 
molecules in the gunpowder and <em>D</em> is the equivalent stored in the bonds 
in the products of the reaction. Thus, the difference between the two, 
<em>E</em> , is the energy released in the reaction. The keen eyed amongst you 
would have spotted a small obstacle in the way at <em>C</em>. This is known as a
<em>potential barrier</em>. In order to get from <em>A</em> to <em>D</em>, 
enough energy must be provided to the bonds of the molecules to overcome this 
barrier, at which point the molecules in the gunpowder break apart and form new 
molecules releasing energy <em>B</em> + <em>E</em>. Note that the energy 
<em>B</em> has been put into the bonds to begin the reaction, so the net result 
is the release of energy <em>E</em>. The energy that is needed to begin the 
reaction is called the <em>activation energy</em>. 
</p>

<img src="media/images/cannons/rockpotential.png" alt="rock potential graph" width="594" height="396"/>

<p class='figdescription'>
Fig 8: The mechanical analogy of a potential barrier.
</p>

<p>One way in which to envisage this concept is to imagine rolling a boulder 
over a hill into a lower valley. Energy must be provided to the boulder to get 
it over the hill, but once it is over it tumbles faster and with more energy 
than it was imparted with. This example can also be represented with a potential
 graph with a potential barrier.
</p>

<h4>Ideal Gases</h4>

<p>
The next step in analysing the physical processes of cannon is to find out how 
the chemical potential energy is transferred to the cannonball.

<p>
For simplicity, we will assume that none of the energy released from the 
reaction is transferred to the surroundings in the form of heat (since the 
process takes place so quickly) or resistive work whilst the cannonball is 
inside the barrel of the cannon.
</p>

<p>
The products of the gunpowder ignition form both solids and gases. We will 
assume that these gases form an ideal gas, that is, a gas described by 
the following law:
</p>

<img src="media/images/cannons/eq2.png" alt="pV=nRT" width="72" height="21"/>

<p>
In the above, <em>p</em> represents pressure, <em>V</em> volume, <em>n</em> the 
number of moles of the gas, <em>R</em> is the gas constant and <em>T</em> is the
 temperature of the gas as measured in Kelvin. (This model is being used to 
 demonstrate some of the underlying physics that governs this weapon. It does 
 not consider the whole picture, so is not applicable to real world systems.)
</p>

<p>
As the reaction is so quick that no heat is lost to the surroundings, it is an 
example of an adiabatic process. For this type of process the quantity  
<em>pV<sup>&gamma;</sup></em> is conserved. That is:
</p>

<img src="media/images/cannons/eq3.png" alt="conservation equation" width="87" height="24"/>

<p>
Here the gamma is the ratio of specific heats. The specific heats of the gas 
when held at a constant pressure and at a constant volume. This formula will be 
useful when calculating the pressure at a later point in time after the initial 
reaction.

<img id='rightskull' src="media/images/skull.png" alt="skull" height="100%"/>

<h6 id='boxtitle1'>Kinetic-Molecular Model (click to expand)</h6>

</div>

<p>
There are four basic assumptions to the model:
</p>

<ul>

<li>A container with volume <em>V</em> contains a very large number <em>N</em>
of identical molecules, each with masss <em>m</em></li>

<li>They behave as point particles that are small compared to the container 
and to the average distance between them.</li>

<li>They are in constant motion and occasionally collide with the walls of 
the container elastically (there is no change in kinetic energy).</li>

<li>The container walls are rigid and infinitely massive, so do not 
move.</li>

</ul>

<p>
These collisions with the walls result in the macroscopic property of pressure. 
In a collision only the perpendicular component of the momentum to the wall 
changes, where it is reversed. Assume a particle travels with the average speed 
<em>v<sub>x</sub></em> along the <em>x</em> direction. Each collision will lead 
to a change in velocity from <em>-v<sub>x</sub></em> to <em>v<sub>x</sub></em> 
or vice versa. Thus, the total change in momentum would be 
<em>&plusmn;2mv<sub>x</sub></em>. Now consider an area on the wall, <em>A</em>.
If a molecule were to collide with the wall within <em>A</em> during a short 
time interval <em>dt</em>, then it would need to be within a cylinder of length 
<em>v<sub>x</sub>dt</em> from the wall. The number of molecules that collide in 
<em>A</em> during <em>dt</em> is equal to the number of molecules within the 
cylinder moving towards the wall. On average, half of the molecules are moving 
towards the wall and half away. The volume of the cylinder is 
<em>Av<sub>x</sub>dt</em> and the number of molecules per unit volume 
<em>N/V</em>, which is taken to be uniform throughout the container. Thus, we 
can write an expression for the number of collisions within this interval:
</p>

<img src="media/images/cannons/eq4.png" alt="num. of collisions eq." width="96"/>

<p>
The total momentum change is simply the number of collisions multiplied by the 
change in momentum per collision:
</p>

<img src="media/images/cannons/eq5.png" alt="change in momentum eq." width="251"/>

<p>
Using Newton's 2nd Law, one can obtain an expression for pressure:
</p>

<img src="media/images/cannons/eq6.png" alt="pressure eq." width="154"/>
<p>
Up until now, only the <em>x</em> direction has been considered. Using 
Pythagoras' theorem, it can be shown that:
</p>

<img src="media/images/cannons/eq7.png" alt="velocity eq." width="111">

<p>where <em>v</em> is the total speed in all three directions. However, no 
direction has any preference, so it can be assumed that the average speed in 
one direction is the same in all directions, so 
<em>v<sub>x</sub>=v<sub>y</sub>=v<sub>z</sub></em>. This implies that 
<em>v<sub>x</sub><sup>2</sup>=&frac13;v<sup>2</sup></em>. Combining this with the 
equation for pressure one finds:
</p>

<img src="media/images/cannons/eq8.png" alt="KE eq." width="159"/>

<p>
Here, <em>KE</em> represents the average kinetic energy of the molecules. If 
none of the energy released from the reaction is transferred to heat or 
 resistive work, then it must all be transferred into kinetic energy, thus 
 <em>KE</em> is equal to the energy released by the reaction.
</p>

<p>
Taking the formula above, combining it with the formula for the work done by a 
gas and the formula for an adiabatic process, it is possible to calculate how 
much energy is transferred to the cannonball and the cannon, <em>E</em>, from 
the reaction:
</p>

<img src="media/images/cannons/eq9.png" alt="E eq." width="475"/>

<p>
<em>V<sub>1</sub></em> describes the volume between the cannonball and the back 
wall of the barrel, whereas <em>V<sub>2</sub></em> describes the volume of the 
barrel in totality.
</p>

<p>
These volumes are dependent on the length of the barrel of the cannon and the 
radius of the barrel. Inspecting Fig 3 below, it is obvious that 
<em>V<sub>1</sub></em> is equivalent to the volume of the charge behind the 
cannonball and the space between the charge and the cannonball due to the 
curvature of the ball. <em>V<sub>2</sub></em> is the volume of the barrel, but 
with half the volume of the cannonball removed as this is the last moment, 
before the cannonball leaves the barrel. Thus the above equation can be 
written as the end result in the main text, where <em>r</em> denotes the radius 
of the barrel, <em>L</em> the length and <em>W<sub>g</sub></em> the width of 
the charge.
</p>

</div>

<p>
In order to find how the energy released by the reaction is transferred to the 
ideal gas, it is necessary to look at the kinetic-molecular model.
</p>

<p>The end result is the following formula:</p>

<img src="media/images/cannons/eq10.png" alt="work done eq." width="634" height="93"/>

<br />

<img src="media/images/cannons/cannonball.png" alt="cannonball in barrel" width="579" height="275"/>

<p class='figdescription'>
Fig 9: The volumes and lengths before the reaction and after the cannonball has 
left the barrel.
</p>

<p>
Given the pressure and therefore force applied to the cannonball it is possible 
to describe the speed of the cannonball leaving the barrel.
</p>

<h4>Newton's Second Law</h4>

<p>
Newton’s 2nd Law describes the relationship between force and acceleration. Once
 the acceleration is known it is then possible to describe the subesequent 
motion of the cannonball. The law states that:
</p>

<img src="media/images/cannons/eq11.png" alt="F=ma" width="53" height="21"/>

<p>
Here, <em>F</em> is the force applied, <em>m</em> the mass of the object the 
force is applied to and <em>a</em> the acceleration. All the physics to find 
the force has been done above as it simply the product of the pressure behind 
the cannonball and the surface area that it is exposed to. This gives the 
following result:
</p>

<img src="media/images/cannons/eq12.png" alt="F=pA" width="188" height="41"/>

<p>
In expressing the force in this way, the air resistance inside the barrel has 
been neglected.
</p>

<p>
Since the acceleration is the second derivative of position and volume is a 
function of position, this equation can be written as (ignoring the effects of 
air resistance within the barrel).
</p>

<img src="media/images/cannons/eq13.png" alt="diff. eq." width="160" height="47"/>

<p>
Now all that remains to be done in setting up the problem is to find the volume 
as a function of position. Take <em>x</em> to be the point on the ball closest 
to the back wall. (See Fig 10)
</p>

<img src="media/images/cannons/cannonback.png" alt="x coordinate diagram" width="382" height="110"/>

<p classs='figdescription'>
Fig 10: Setting the <em>x</em> coordinate to the back of the cannonball.
</p>
<p>
The volume is now rather simple to describe. It is just a cylinder with cross 
sectional area <em>&pi;r<sup>2</sup></em> and height <em>x</em> plus the space 
between the point demarcated by the <em>x</em> coordinate and the cannonball, 
which has already been calculated. Thus:
</p>

<img src="media/images/cannons/eq14.png" alt="V(x) eq." width="219" height="42"/>

<p>
Plugging this into the equation for the acceleration results in a second order 
nonlinear differential equation in x:
</p>

<img src="media/images/cannons/eq15.png" alt="acceleration ODE" width="353" height="70"/>

<p>
Analytically this equation is solvable for both velocity and position, however 
it is rather complicated to perform, so it will be solved numerically. As stated previously, this model is not 
accurate in describing the firing of cannon in the real world as too many 
assumptions have been made for simplicity so that the physical concepts 
governing the system can be explained with more ease. Thus it is more useful to 
just show the shape of the solution to the above equation:

<p class='figdescription'>
Fig 12: The velocity of a cannonball as a function of time after the reaction.
</p>

<p>
Note that even in the absence of air resistance there is a maximum velocity 
that the cannonball tends to as the length of the barrel tends to infinity.
</p>

<p>
This is more explicit from the equation of acceleration, where the acceleration 
is inversely proportional to the volume. As the length of the barrel tends to 
infinity the volume tends to infinity and thus the acceleration tends to zero.
</p>

<p class='figdescription'>
Fig 13: The speed of the projectile as a function of the distance along the 
barrel for large barrel length.
</p>

<p>
The differences between the model's assumptions and a real cannon are as 
follows:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
Much of the energy released by the reaction does go into thermal energy that is 
lost to the surroundings (A rather large amount). Not only does this reduce the 
available kinetic energy, but complicates dramatically the thermodynamic laws 
that govern the system.
 </li>

<li>
Air resistance plays a large role in the barrel, which has not been accounted 
for here, resulting in a lower exit velocity of the cannonball.
</li>

<li>
The gas formed in the reaction does not actually form an ideal gas.
</li>

<li>
The cannonball does not form an airtight seal with the barrel, so some of the 
pressure is lost without doing work on the cannonball during the process
</li>

</ul>

<h4>An Example</h4>

<p>
Cannon were used throughout the American war of independence. During this 
conflict one such cannon was used to the great effect as it bridged the gap 
between heavier and light cannon of the time becoming a great ‘all-rounder’. 
This was the U.S. Model 1857 12-Pounder Napoleon. It fires a 12-lb shot, which 
is equivalent to about five and half kilograms. It used two and a half pounds 
of black powder each time that it fired, which would release almost three and a 
half megajoules. This energy gives the cannonball an initial velocity of  453 
m/s and a maximum range of 1520 metres. See the page on projectile motion for 
more information on this.
