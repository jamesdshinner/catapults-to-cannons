<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>
In this project, we aimed to give an overview of the use of projectile weapons 
throughout history in warfare.
</p>

<p>
The motion of all projectiles in motion can be calculated using Newtonian 
mechanics and we showed how the SUVAT equations can be used to calculate the 
trajectory, speed, range and time of flight of a launched projectile. As most 
quantities associated with projectiles have both a magnitude and direction, we 
saw how to model these using vectors, and the operations of these mathematical 
objects. We also looked at the physics of rotating bodies, as rotational motion 
was often imparted to launched projectiles to improve their accuracy.
</p>

<p>
We examined the early siege weapons, where all energy was imparted to a 
projectile by way of gravity. This was the norm for almost two millennia, and 
we looked at the various advancements made to throw more massive projectiles 
further and with more velocity.
</p>

<p>
The invention of gunpowder revolutionised projectile warfare, and we saw in the 
section on cannon the process by which chemical potential energy is converted 
into kinetic energy, allowing much greater ranges to be covered.
</p>

<p>
With the ever increasing power of weaponry, we looked at how the rocket equation
governs the physics of rockets, and saw examples from world war two of their 
use with devastating effect. We saw in the Patriot missile system the prime 
importance of ensuring accuracy in calculations made with the high stakes 
involved in warfare. We also examined the physics behind electromagnetic 
railguns, a completely different approach to providing kinetic energy to a 
projectile that is at the cutting edge of weapons of the present and near 
future.
</p>

<p>
The development of projectile weapons has always come back to the same 
fundamental principle: how much energy can one impart to a projectile. The more 
energy a projectile is given at launch, the more damaging it is upon arriving 
at its target. The progress through history has been relentless, with the 
weapons of today providing energy many orders of magnitude greater than the 
earliest weapons developed. This can be seen clearly in the following video, 
where we compare the trajectories of the weapons we have examined, seeing the 
vast difference in scales:
